title: Vendor Agnostic
description: If you do not want to use Docusaurus, the Alt.Docusaurus.Powershell module can also produce vendor agnostic output.

No matter how much we :heart: Docusaurus, we realize it will not be the right solution for everyone as users might:

- Prefer different (non-javascript) languages
- Need to maintain an existing solution
- Simply not like the green lizard

## TL;DR

If you want to produce enriched markdown files for your Get-Help documentation **but do not want to use Docusaurus** simply run:

```powershell
New-DocusaurusHelp -Module "YourModule" -VendorAgnostic
```

## How Does It Work?

By passing the `-VendorAgnostic` switch parameter this module will generate the exact same
markdown as always but will skip two Docusaurs-specific steps during the process:

1. Front matter
2. Docusaurus sidebar file

### Front Matter

The PlatyPS generated markdown front matter:

- Will not be touched
- Will look similar to the example below
- Will need to be post-processed (by you) to match your needs

```yml
---
external help file: Alt3.Docusaurus.Powershell-help.xml
Module Name: Alt3.Docusaurus.Powershell
online version: https://docusaurus-powershell.vercel.app/
schema: 2.0.0
---
```

### Docusaurus Sidebar File

The Docusaurus-specific `docusaurus.sidebar.js` file will not be generated.

If your solution/vendor requires a similar list you will need to generate one yourself,
perhaps using the
[NewSideBarIncludeFile](https://github.com/alt3/Docusaurus.Powershell/blob/main/Source/Private/NewSidebarIncludeFile.ps1)
function for inspiration.
